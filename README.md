# Instalock
If it crashes just restart.
To be safe only start it after starting league.
When you start the exe and league is open click start and wait until the START button says RUNNING

How to use:


       start league client
       start exe
       choose path to lockfile (maybe this C:\Riot Games\League of Legends) only need to do this once
       click on the champion you want
       choose role
       press start (to stop running press the button again)
       start queue in league client
   the exe will autoaccept for you and choose the champ you want and role call
